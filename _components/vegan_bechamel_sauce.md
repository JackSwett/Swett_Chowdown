title: "Vegan Bechamel Sauce"
tags: vegan, sauce 
yield: "about 2 cups"

ingredients:
- 2 cups (475 ml) unsweetened almond or oat milk
- 1 Turkish bay leaf (or 1/2 small California bay leaf)
- 5 sprigs fresh thyme
- 10 whole black peppercorns
- 3 medium cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed
- 3 tablespoons (45 ml) refined neutral coconut oil (or other neutral oil like safflower, canola or peanut)
- 3 tablspoons (25 grams) all-purpose flour
- pinch freshly grated nutmeg
- Kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper

directions: 
- In a small saucepan, combine the almond milk, bay leaf, thyme, peppercorns, and garlic; bring to simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a bare simmer for 20 minutes. Using a small strainer placed over a heat-proof measuring cup, strain the infused almond milk and discard the aromatics. Set aside. This mixture can be made ahead of time and refrigerated. 
- Heat the coconut oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the flour and cook, whisking slowly but continuously, until the flour is cooked and no longer smells raw, about 2 minutes. Do not allow the flour to brown. 
- While whisking continuously, very slowly add the infused almond milk in a thin stream to the cooked flour mixture. At first the sauce will get very thick, very fast, but continue whisking (into the corners of the pan!) and the sauce will thin out once all the infused almond milk is added. 
- While slowly and continuously whisking, allow the sauce to come to a simmer. Reduce the heat to low, continue whisking slowly, until the sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. (You should be able to drag a line through the sauce on the back of the spoon.)Remove from the heat.
- Season to taste with nutmeg, salt, abd freshly ground black pepper. 
- Use immediately for lasagna or other recipe, or transfer to an air-tight container and lay a piece of plastic film directly on the surface of the sauce. Cover with the container's lid and refrigerate for up to 3 days. The sauce can be reheated to a thinner consistency in a microwave oven on medium or in a small saucepan over low heat while stirring continuously. If the sauce is too thick after having been reheated, add a bit more almond milk to thin.

A very useful vegan version of bechamel or white sauce. Works beautifully in Vegan Lasagna alla Bolognese, but also in any recipe that requires a bechamel. Adapted from seriouseats.com
