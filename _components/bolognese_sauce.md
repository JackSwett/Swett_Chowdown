title:  "Bolognese Sauce"
image: BologneseSauce.jpg
yield: 2-¹/₂ cups

ingredients:
- 2 tablespoons yellow onion (chopped)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons celery (chopped)
- 2 tablespoons carrots (chopped)
- ³/₄ pounds lean ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup dry white wine
- ¹/₂ cup milk
- ¹/₈ teaspoon nutmeg
- 2 cups Italian tomatoes (roughly chopped, with their juice)

directions:
- An earthenware pot should be your first choice for making ragù. If you don't have one available, use a heavy, enameled cast-iron casserole, the deepest one you have (to keep the ragù from reducing too quickly). Put in the chopped onion, with all the oil and butter, and sauté briefly over medium heat until just translucent. Add the celery and carrot and cook gently for 2 minutes.
- Add the ground beef, crumbling it in the pot with a fork. Add salt, stir, and cook only until the meat has lost its raw, red color. Add the wine, turn the heat up to medium high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until all the wine has evaporated.
- Turn the heat down to medium, add the milk and the nutmeg, and cook until the milk has evaporated. Stir frequently.
- When the milk has evaporated, add the tomatoes and stir thoroughly. When the tomatoes have started to bubble, turn the heat down until the sauce cooks at the laziest simmer, just an occasional bubble. Cook, uncovered, for a minimum of 3-1/2 to 4 hours, stirring occasionally. Taste and correct for salt.

notes:
- If you cannot watch the sauce for such a long stretch, you can turn off the heat and resume cooking it later on. But do finish cooking it in one day.
- Ragù can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or frozen. Reheat until it simmers for about 15 minutes before using.

Ragù is not to be confused with ragoût. A ragoût is a French meat stew, while ragù is Bologna's meat sauce for seasoning its homemade pasta. The only thing they share is a common and justified origin in the verb ragoût, which means "to excite the appetite."

A properly made ragù clinging to the folds of homemade noodles is one of the most satisfying experiences accessible to the sense of taste. It is no doubt one of the great attractions of the enchanting city of Bologna, and the Bolognese claim one cannot make a true ragù anywhere else. This may be so, but with a little care, we can come very close to it. There are three essential points you must remember to make a successful ragù:
- The meat must be sautéed just barely long enough to lsoe its raw color. It must not brown or it will lose delicacy.
- It must be cooked in milk before the tomatoes are added. This keeps the meat creamier and sweeter tasting.
- It must cook at the merest simmer for a long, long time. The minimum is 3-1/2 hours; 5 is better.
