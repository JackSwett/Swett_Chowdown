tags: vegan, pasta, sauce
yield: "about 2 quarts"

ingredients:
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium onion (about 12 oz/340 grams), finely minced
- 1 large carrot (about 8 oz/225 grams), finely minced
- 3 ribs celery (about 6 oz/170 grams), finely minced
- 5 medium cloves of garlic, finely minced (about x tablespoons)
- 1 lb. (450 grams) cemini mushrooms, stems discarded and caps crumbled by hand into pea-size morsels
- 1 lb. (450 grams) seitan, drained and crumbled by hand into pea-size morsels
- 1 tablespoon (15 ml) tomato paste
- 1-1/2 cups (355 ml) dry red wine
- 1, 28 oz (795 grams) can peeled whole tomatoes, pureed or crushed by hand
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) red (aka) miso
- 2 tablespoons (30 ml) refined neutral coconut oil (or another neutral oil like canola, safflower or peanut)
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) dark soy sauce (or regular soy sauce)
- 1 large dried Turkish bay leaf (or 1 small California bay leaf)
- 3-4 fresh sage leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried sage)
- 1 sprig fresh rosemary (or 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Freshly grated nutmeg

directions:
- Heat a dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the olive oil. Heat until shimmering. Add the onion, carrot, and celery. Cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until the onion is just beginning to turn golden, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
- Add the mushrooms and seitan. Cook, stirring and scraping frequently, until the water in the mushrooms and seitan evaporates and a light brown film begins to develop on the bottom of the pot, about x minutes.
- Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 30 seconds. Add the wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the wine has nearly evaporated and no longer smells of alcohol, about 5 minutes.
- Stir in the pureed tomatoes, miso, coconut oil, soy sauce, bay leaf, sage, and rosemary. Bring the mixture back to a simmer and cook until the sauce has reduced and thickened, about 30 minutes.
- Discard the bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in a few scrapings of nutmeg.
- At this point, the sauce can be refrigerated in a tighly sealed container for about a week or frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat before proceeding to make Vegan Lasagna alla Bolognese.
