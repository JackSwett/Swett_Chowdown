title:  "Béchamel Sauce"
image: BechamelSauce.jpg
yield: 2-¹/₂ cups

ingredients:
- 3 cups milk
- 6 tablespoons butter
- 4-¹/₂ tablespoons all-purpose flour
- ¹/₄ teaspoon salt

directions:
- In a small pan, heat the milk until it comes to the very edge of a boil.
- While you are heating the milk, melt the butter over low heat in a heavy enameled iron saucepan of 6 cups capacity.
- Turn off the heat and add the hot milk 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring it constantly into the flour-and-butter mixture. As soon as the first 2 tablespoons have been incorporated into the mixture, add another 2 tablespoons, always stirring with your trusty spoon. When you have added 1/2 cup of milk to the mixture, you can start adding 1/4 cup at a time, until you have added it all. (Never add more than 1/4 cup at one time)
- When all the milk has been incorporated, turn on the heat to low, add the salt, and stir-cook until the sauce is as dense as thick cream. If you need it thicker, cook and stir a little while longer. If you need it thinner, cook a little less.

notes:
- When the sauce cools, it sets, and you will not be able to spread it. Therefore, inasmuch as it takes so little time to prepare, it is best to make it just before you are ready to use it. If you must make it in advance, reheat it slowly, stirring constantly until it is the right consistency again. Béchamel sauce can also be refrigerated.

Long before the French christened it "béchamel," a sauce of flour and milk cooked in butter, called balsamella, was  apart of the cooking of Romagna. It is essential to many of its pastas and vegetables, and such an unquestionably native dish as lasagne could not exist without it.

Balsamella is possibly the simplest and most quickly made of sauces. The only problem it poses is the formation of lumps. If you add the milk as directed, a little bit at a time, off the ehat, beating the sauce constantly with a wooden spoon, you should have absolutely no difficulty in producing a perfectly smooth balsamella every time.
