title: "The World's Easiest Vegan Sticky Buns" 
image:
tags: vegan, breakfast, pastry 
yield: "10 sticky buns"

ingredients:
- 1 cup unsweetened almond or oat milk
- 3 tablespoons vegan butter, preferably unsalted 
- 1 packet rapid rise (instant) yeast (about 2-1/4 teaspoons)
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2-1/2 to 3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
- neutral vegetable oil

- 1/2 cup vegan butter, preferably unsalted, melted
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/2 cup toasted pecans, chopped

- 1/4 cup vegan butter, preferably unsalted, melted
- 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
- 1/2 tablespoon ground cinnamon

directions:
- In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the almond or oat milk and 3 tablespoons vegan butter just ntil the vegan butter has melted. Do not boil. Remove from the heat and let cool to 110 degrees F. 
- Transfer the milk mixture to a large mixing bowl and add the yeast. Let sit 10 minutes, then stir in 1 tablespoon sugar and the salt. 
- Add the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is too thick to stir, but still a bit sticky. Transfer to a floured surface and continue kneading a minute or so, adding just as much flour as you need to make a smooth dough, but not a dry one. 
- Transfer the lightly kneaded dough to a well-oiled large mixing bowl, turning the dough around so all sides are coated in the oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free location until the dough has almost doubled in size, about 1 hour. 
- Meanwhile, in a small mixing bowl, stir together the  1/2 cup melted vegan butter and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Spead the mixture evenly over the bottom of an 8- x 8-inch baking pan. Spread the toasted pecans evenly over the sugar mixture and set aside. 
- In another small mixing bowl, stir together the remaining 1/4 cup vegan butter and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Set aside. 
- Once the dough has nearly doubled in size, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and pat/roll it out into a thin rectangle about x- by x-inches. Spread the reserved sugar mixture evenly over the dough and sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon. 
- Starting along the long side, tightly roll the dough, jelly-roll style. Secure the roll by pinching a narrow seam with your fingers along the long edge of the dough. Place the roll seam side down on the floured work surface. Using a serrated knife or dental floss, cut the roll into 10 even buns. Place the rolls in a single layer in the prepared pan, cover the pan with plastic wrap, and set aside again in a warm, draft-free location while you preheat the oven.
- Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. When the oven is hot, remove the plastic wrap from the pan of buns. Bake the buns until lightly golden, about 25-30 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool briefly on a wire rack. Carefully invert the pan over a larger plate or platter (to catch any extra hot sugar goo!) and serve immediately.

No need to fear yeast dough with this recipe. Easy, gooey, delicious. Try to find a vegan butter made especially for baking -- Miyoko's unsalted works great. Best served warm, but they can be re-heated briefly in the microwave, roll by roll, if you have leftovers. No more than 10 seconds at most. Adapted from minimalistbaker.com
