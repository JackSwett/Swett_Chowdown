title:  "Dutch Minicakes"
image:
tags: dessert
yield: "2-¹/₂ dozen, 1-¹/₂ inch minicakes"

ingredients:
- ¹/₃ cup (46 grams) all-purpose flour, unsifted
- 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, unsifted
- ¹/₂ teaspoon baking powder
- 6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter
- 170 grams semisweet chocolate, chopped
- ¹/₂ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 115 grams toasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped to yield 1 cup
- ¹/₄ cup (25 grams) powdered sugar, for decoration

directions:
- Adjust rack to lower third of oven and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Line 2-¹/₂ dozen miniature muffin cups that measure 1-¹/₂ inches by ³/₄ inch width miniature cupcake liners.
- Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder on a sheet of waxed paper; set aside. In a small saucepan, melt the butter and chocolate over very low heat. Remove from heat; stir in the sugar. Pour into a 3-quart mixing bowl; set aside to cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the eggs and vanilla, stirring just until blended. Stir in the flour mixture, then the nuts.
- Fill each paper-lined muffin cup three-quarters full. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes only. Don't overbake. Remove pans to wire racks to cool 5 minutes to allow cakes to firm a bit. Carefully remove cakes to other racks to cool. Sprinkle with powdered sugar before serving.
- These are best eaten the same day they are baked; or freeze, in airtight sturdy plastic containers, up to 1 month.


notes:
- The minicakes are prettier without the muffin papers. If the minicakes are not already frozen, freeze them for 30 minutes. The papers can be lifted quickly and easily from the rich sticky surfaces without altering the shape of the cakes.
