title: "Vegan Lasagna alla Bolognese"
image:
tags: pasta, vegan
yield: 1, 9- by 13-inch pan

ingredients:
- 1 lb (450 grams) dry lasagna noodles (egg-free) cooked about 2 minutes less than package instructions indicate, drained and set aside in ice water
- olive oil

components: 
- Vegan Seitan and Mushroom Ragu Bolognese
- Vegan Bechamel Sauce

directions:
- Make the Vegan Seitan and Mushroom Ragu Bolognese and Vegan Bechamel Sauce. 
- Stir 1/2 cup (120 ml) of the Vegan Bechamel Sauce into the Vegan Seitan and Mushroom Ragu Bolognese. Set aside.
- Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. (220 degrees C.) 
- Lighly oil the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish, then cover the bottom of the pan with a layer of drained and patted-dry lasagna sheets. 
- Spread a thin, even layer of Bolognese on top of the pasta, then drizzle lightly with some of the remaining Bechamel. Repeat the pasta, Bolognese, and Bechamel layers until the pan is full, taking care to end with a layer of Bolgnese and Bechamel. 
- Place the baking dish on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until browned and bubbling, about 25 minutes. Let the lasagne rest another 20 minutes before cutting and serving.
