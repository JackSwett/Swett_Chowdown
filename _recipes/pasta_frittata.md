ingredients:
- ¹/₂ pound spaghetti
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 150 grams onion
- 170 grams bacon
- 8 large eggs
- 10-20 grinds black pepper
- 50 grams parmesan

directions:
- Dice onion. Cook onion with 3 tbs. of butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet on low heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until onions become soft and golden. Transfer onions to a small bowl and set aside. Leave any oil in the cast iron.
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Cook bacon in cast-iron skillet. Transfer bacon to a cutting board before they become crispy. Discard of bacon grease in an appropriate container. Dice bacon.
- Add spaghetti to boiling water and cook molto al dente. It should still be firm, but not crunchy when drained into a colander. Run cold water over the pasta until it is room temperature. Leave it to drain completely.
- In a large bowl, add onion, bacon, and spaghetti. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, using a fork. Add cheese and pepper.
- Using a paper towel, use the remaining butter to generously grease the cast-iron skillet. Pour in the mixture and cook on low heat for 10 minutes. Once the bottom has firmed up, transfer the skillet to the oven and cook until the center is firm (approx. 15 minutes).
