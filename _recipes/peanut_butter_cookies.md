title:  "Peanut Butter Cookies"
image: pb-cookies.jpg
tags: cookie, dessert
yield: "Approx. 4 dozen, 31-gram, cookies"

ingredients:
- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 200 grams granulated sugar
- 220 grams brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 450 grams peanut butter
- 375 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt

directions:
- Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or a handheld mixer or a wooden spoon), cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium speed for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture is light and fluffy. (This step will take about 10 minutes if using a handheld mixer or spoon.) Stop the mixer a few times and use a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom  of the bowl and the paddle to release any clinging butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs and vanilla on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, or until thoroughly combined. Scrape the bowl and paddle again to make sure the eggs are thoroughly incorporated. On medium-low speed, beat in the peanut butter for another 2 minutes, or until thoroughly combined.
- In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt until well mixed. On low speed (or with the wooden spoon), slowly add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture and then mix just until the dry ingredients are totally incorporated and the dough is evenly mixed.
- For the best results, scrape the dough into an airtight container and let it rest in the refrigerator for 3 to 12 hours before baking. When you are ready to bake, position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
- Drop the dough in 31-gram balls onto a baking sheet, spacing them to fit a dozen per half-sheet. Flatten each ball slightly with the palm of your hand. Use a fork to create the traditional crisscross pattern on the top of each cookie. Dipping the fork in sugar can help keep the dough from sticking to it.
- Bake the cookies for 18 to 20 minutes, or until the cookies are golden brown on the edges and still pale and slightly soft in the center. Let cool on the baking sheet on a wire rack for 5 to 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to the rack and cool completely.
