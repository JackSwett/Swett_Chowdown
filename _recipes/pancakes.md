image: Pancake.jpg
tags: breakfast
yield: '8 - 5" pancakes'

ingredients:
- 2 large eggs
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 1 cup milk
- 1-¹/₄ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- ³/₄ teaspoons salt

directions:
- Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until they are thoroughly blended.
- Put the butter and the milk in a small saucepan and warm over low heat until the butter has melted. Set aside and allow to cool a little -- you don't want to add this mixture to the eggs while it is very hot or it will cook the eggs.
- Stir the butter mixture into the eggs and mix well. Put the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a bowl and stir with a fork until well mixed.
- Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture and stir only until the dry ingredients are well moistened. Don't overmix.
- Heat a griddle or skillet until a few drops of water dance on it, then lightly film with grease, Drop 2 or 3 tablespoons of batter for each pancake onto the griddle (a 12-inch griddle will hold 4 pancakes) and cook until bubbles break on the surface. Turn the pancake over and cook another 30 seconds, or until the bottom is lightly browned.
- Serve the pancakes hot. Extra pancakes can be refrigerated for a few days and reheated in a pan or toaster oven.

From *unknown* recipe book: This basic pancake tastes better than all the others I've tried. Like any good recipe, it is versatile: you can add fresh berries, fruit, granola, spices, and flavors. Pancake batter and waffle batter differ only in that the waffle batter is usually thinner. Add a little more liquid to pancake batter and it will cook up as a good, self-respecting waffle.
