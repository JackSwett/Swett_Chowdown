image: CinnamonBun.jpeg
tags: breakfast, dessert
yield: "18-20 buns"

ingredients:
- 4-³/₄ to 5-¹/₄ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 package fast-rising dry yeast
- ¹/₃ cup granulated sugar
- ¹/₃ cup instant non-fat dry milk
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1-¹/₄ cups water
- ¹/₄ cup vegetable oil
- 1 large egg (room-temperature)

components:
- Cinnamon Roll Filling

directions:
- Combine 1 3/4 cup of flour, the yeast, granulated sugar milk powder, and salt into a large mixer bowl. Combine water and oil in a small saucepan and heat to 125 - 130 degrees.
- With mixer on low speed beat liquid into dry ingredients until blended.
- Raise speed to high and beat for 2 1/2 minutes Add egg and beat for 1 minute longer.
- Vigorously stir in about 2 1/2 cups more flour, or enough to yield a knead-able dough.
- Turn dough out on a clean, lightly floured surface. Gradually knead in enough more flour to yield a smooth and manageable but nut dry dough. Shape dough into a ball and transfer to a large well-greased bowl.
- Grease dough top. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set aside in a very warm spot (80-90 degrees) for 25 minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare two 9- or 10-inch round or square baking pans or deep dish pie plates as follows; Grease each pan with 2 1/2 tablespoons softened butter. (reserve rest for brushing on dough).
- Drizzle 1/4 cup corn syrup in each pan; tip pans back and forth to coat with syrup. Sprinkle 2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar over corn syrup in each pan; reserve remainder for sprinkling over dough. Set pans aside.
- Punch down dough and turn out into a clean, lightly floured surface. Knead for 1 minute, adding a bit of flour if required to make dough slightly more firmer and more manageable.
- Roll out dough to an 18 -by 12-inch rectangle. Brush reserved butter evenly over dough surfaces. Sprinkle cinnamon, then reserved brown sugar, then nuts over dough.
- Working from the longer side, roll up dough jellyroll-style. Stretch out and adjust the roll slightly, as needed, to yield an evenly thick log. Cut crosswise into 18 to 20 slices.
- Lay slices in prepared pans and cover pans with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to 36 hours.
- About 15 minutes before baking time, remove buns from refrigerator to warm up slightly. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
- Bake buns for 28 to 33 minutes, or until tinged with brown on top and slightly springy to the touch. Immediately invert each pan of buns over a platter and serve, Bun are best when served warn from the oven.
