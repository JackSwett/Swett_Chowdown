title: "Vegan Peerfect Pie Crust"
image: VeganPerfectPieCrust
tags: dessert, pastry
yield: "2, 9-inch pie crusts"

ingredients:
- 2 cups (300 grams) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 12 tablespoons (1-1/2 sticks/168 grams) unsalted vegan butter, grated on a large-hole grater and frozen until very cold
- 1-1/2 teaspoons (7 ml) apple cider or white vinegar
- 4 tablespoons (45 ml) ice cold water

directions:
- In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Alternatively, pulse in the bowl of a food processor just to combine. 
- Add the vegan butter shreds and, using your fingers, toss and lightly pinch the mixture until the mixture is sandy but with some small pea-size bits still visable. If using the food processor, pulse a few times until the mixture is sandy but with some small pea-size bits still visable.
- Add the vinegar and water; toss with a fork until the liquid has been absorbed. Continue stirring, in a quick circular motion, until the mixture starts to come together in a shaggy mass. Alternatively, pulse the mixture in the food processor for 60-90 seconds where the dough will almost form a ball in the last few seconds.
- Divide the dough into two rough balls and flatten as best you can into 2 discs about 1" thick. Wrap each disc tightly and then flatten a bit more to create a more solid disc.
- Let rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or up to 3 days, before rolling out.

notes:
- There are several vegan butters on the market, but Miyoko's Creamery's European Style UNSALTED Cultured Vegan Butter performs exactly like dairy butter in this recipe. Not always easy to find the unsalted, but it is also available on their website.
