ingredients:
- 1 cup milk
- ¹/₄ cup butter, melted
- 1 large egg

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- ¹/₂ cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder

directions:
- Heat oven to 400°F (200°C). Grease bottom and side of an 8-10 inch cast-iron skillet with butter.
- In a large bowl, whisk together milk, butter, and egg. Stir in remaining ingredients all at once just until flour is moistened. The batter should be a little lumpy. Pour into skillet.
- Bake 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

notes:
- Corn muffins use the same recipe. Simply grease the muffin pan with butter and distribute batter evenly.
