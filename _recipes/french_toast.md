image: ERROR.png
tags: breakfast, dessert

ingredients:
- 1 egg
- 1/3 cup milk
- dash of cinnamon
- few fine strands of orange zest
- 2 slices slightly stale, sturdy bread (rustic country style, sourdough, etc.)
- 1 Tablespoon butter

directions:
- In a shallow pie plate, or similar dish, whisk together the egg, milk, cinnamon, and orange zest.
- Place the sliced bread in the egg mixture; allow to soak, turning the slices over once or twice, until they become damp through to the center. Especially sturdy bread may require you to push on the bread like a sponge to help it soak up the egg mixture.
- Heat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, melt a bit of the butter where you will place your bread. When the butter is melted, place the soaked bread on the melted butter spots and cook until golden. Flip the toasts and continue cooking until golden on the second side -- you may need to adjust your heat downward if they are browning too quickly and the center of the toasts are still very wet.
- Serve immediately with warmed maple syrup or topping of your choice.
