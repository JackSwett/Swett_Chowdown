title:  "Potato Rolls"
image:  
tags:   bread
yield:  "1, 9x13 pan"

ingredients:
- 2-³/₄ teaspoons dry yeast (not instant)
- 1-¹/₂ teaspoons granulated sugar
- ¹/₄ cup warm water (115°F)
- ¹/₂ cup mashed russet potato
- ³/₄ cup potato cooking water
- ¹/₄ cup half & half
- 2-¹/₂ tablespoons granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 7 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 large egg
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1-¹/₂ teaspoons table salt

directions:
- In a small bowl combine 2-³/₄ dry yeast, 1-¹/₂ teaspoons sugar, and ¹/₄ cup warm water. Let proof 5-10 minutes or until good and bubbly.
- While the yeast proofs… In a small saucepan, combine ½ cup mashed potato, ¾ cups of water from cooking the potatoes, ¹/₄ cup half & half, 2-¹/₂ tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 7 tablespoons unsalted butter; heat over low heat until the butter is melted. Set aside and let cool to room temperature or a bit warmer
- Once the butter mixture has cooled….In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine 3 cups all-purpose flour and 1-¹/₂ teaspoons salt (I use regular table salt, not kosher in this recipe). Add the melted butter mixture and the egg; mix until combined. Add enough additional flour to make a soft but manageable dough (no more than 1-¹/₂ cups). Knead by hand or in the mixer about 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should become very smooth and elastic – you’re there when it feels like a baby’s bottom when you give it a little pat. Transfer to a buttered bowl, cover with a damp cloth ( I cover the damp cloth with plastic wrap to keep in the moisture) and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size.
- Once the dough has doubled in size… GENTLY deflate the dough by lifting it up and gently patting it down (if you are too rough, it will get too elastic and hard to form into balls). Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and using a knife or bench knife, cut into small portions. Form into balls (it depends on how many rolls you want – it works equally well if you make small rolls or larger ones.)  Arrange in a well-buttered 9x13-inch baking pan (I like a light colored one so they don’t get too brown while baking – glass works well, too, but lower the baking temp 25°F).  Cover with a damp cloth or well-buttered piece of plastic wrap and let rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size (leave a bit for the oven to push!)
- Preheat the oven to 400°F.
- Bake until golden brown, about 15 to 20 minutes. (Someone once said 170°F. is the temp that dough is cooked – I go by color and feel when I tap the tops.)
- Let cool 10 minutes or so, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool more. Serve slightly warm or room temperature.

notes:
- These freeze beautifully. Once they are just cool, wrap in foil, then wrap the foil packages in plastic wrap or place in freezer style zip-lock bags. To reheat, take off the plastic wrap but leave the rolls wrapped in the foil. Heat in a 350°F oven until hot – 15 minutes or so.
