title:  "Baked Macaroni and Cheese"
image: BakedMacAndCheese.jpg
tags: dinner, cheese
yield: 1 loaf

ingredients:
- 2-¹/₂ cups milk
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 pound pasta
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1-¹/₂ cups grated sharp cheddar or Emmenthal
- ¹/₂ cup grated parmesan
- 1 pinch salt (to taste)
- 5 grinds black pepper (to taste)
- ¹/₂ cup bread crumbs

directions:
- Preheat the over to 400 degrees F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
- Cook the milk with the bay leaves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. When small bubbles appear along the sides, about 5 minutes later, turn off the heat and let stand. Salt the boiling water and cook pasta to the point where it still needs another minute or two to become tender. Drain it, rinse it quickly to stop cooking, and place it in a large bowl.
- In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, melt 3 tablespoons of the butter, when it is foamy, add the flour and cook, stirring, until the mixture browns, about 5 minutes. Remove the bay leaves from the milk and add about 1/4 cup of the milk to the hot flour mixture. As soon as the mixture becomes smooth, add a little more milk, and continue to do so until all the milk is used up and the mixture is thick and smooth. Add the Cheddar or Emmenthal and stir.
- Pour the sauce over the noodles, toss in the Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper. Use the remaining butter to grease a 9x13-inch or like-sized baking pan and turn the noodle mixture into it. Top liberally  with bread crumbs and bake until the crumbs turn brown, about 15 minutes. Serve hot.

This is macaroni and cheese for grown-ups; not that kids won't like it, but it's far from sweet and gooey. Rather, it is fragrant and almost sharp, thanks to the bay leaves and Parmesan.
