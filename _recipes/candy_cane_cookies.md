title:  "Candy Cane Cookies"
image: candy-cane-cookies.jpg
tags: dessert, baking
yield: "About 4-dozen cookies"

ingredients:
- 1 cup shortening
- 1 cup sifted confectioners' sugar
- 1 egg
- 1-¹/₂ teaspoons almond extract
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2-¹/₂ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ¹/₂ teaspoons red food coloring
- ¹/₂ cup crushed peppermint candy
- ¹/₂ granulated sugar

directions:
- Mix shortening, sugar, egg, and extracts thoroughly. Mix flour and salt; stir into shortening mixture. Divide dough in half. Blend food coloring into one half.
- Heat oven to 375°F.
- Roll a 4-inch strip from each color (approx. 1 tsp. of dough). For smooth, even strips, roll them back and forth on lightly floured board. Place strips side by side, press lightly together and twist like rope. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Curve top down to form handle of cane.
- Bake about 9 minutes, until lightly browned. While still warm, remove from baking sheet with spatula and sprinkle with mixture of candy and sugar.

notes:
- For best results, complete cookies one at a time—if all the dough of one color is shaped first, strips become too dry to twist.
